# Concurrency
Simulations involving concurrent operations, implemented by using threads (POSIX pthreads) mutex locks, semaphores, and conditional signals in C

Each question has its own README.md.

Question 1 involves mergesorting using processes, threads, and arrays, and comparing the run times.

Question 2 uses mutex locks to implement a simulation.

Question 3 uses semaphores, mutex locks and conditional variables to simulate a real-world situation.

Run all c files using 

gcc <file_name>.c -lpthread; ./a.out
